# Documentation 

## Part I: Project Information

* [a relative link](intro.md)
* Requirements Document: 

Introduction (2%)
- Describe the world you are trying to model. Include everything that you feel is
relevant. This should be around 1/2 to a full page.
• Requirements Document (3%)
- List of functions, requirements, user stories, use cases, etc. that your application
must fulfill. This must be at least 1 page (otherwise you have a really small app
and that's not good), but doesn't have to be terribly much longer. Make sure to
talk about your security measures, special functionality, and how you export data! 

## Part II: The Design Process
• Explanation of design decisions that you made in creating your application (i.e.
why you choose the type of app you did, why that language, if your database
should be secure, did you secure it and how, anything interesting or relevant,
etc.) (2%)
- Describe your thinking as to why you did certain things (around 1/2 a page)
• An E-R diagram (5%)
- Make sure you model EVERYTHING in your database! Don't leave out stuff!
• Database schema including integrity constraints (2%)
- Just give the schemas straight from your database with things like primary key,
unique, not null, etc. Easy 2% here.
• Proof that your database is in Third Normal Form (5%)
- Take your tables and perform the tests we went over in class. Be thorough. Do
NOT skip steps. 

## Part III: Evaluation of Product
• A description of the testing procedures for the database and the application (2%)
- If you didn't test, you didn't do good design. You don't have to go into unit
tests, etc., but just give a general idea of what you did to make sure that
everything works.
• Sample data and sample queries from your application (2%)
- Give an idea of what your database does without having to load it.
• Grammar, spelling, etc. (2%)
- Your document should be proofread and free from error.
